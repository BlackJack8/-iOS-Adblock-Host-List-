### Report issues
If you notice any ads please report it to me via Reddit **[/u/neidhardterik](https://www.reddit.com/u/neidhardterik)**.  
Create an [issue](issues/new) to report false positives, missing content and/or breaking functionality.

### Note
Please be aware that ads on Youtube, Messenger, Instagram and some other social media platforms can't be blocked due to the special host format.  

This is because the domain names that serve those type of ads are also used in legitimate content, which means blocking them will result in the app missing content or losing functionality.
